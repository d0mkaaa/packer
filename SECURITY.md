## 🔍 Security Measures

### Current Security Features

#### Package Verification
- **GPG Signature Verification**: Validates package authenticity
- **Checksum Validation**: Ensures package integrity using SHA-256
- **Source Verification**: Validates package sources and repositories

#### Network Security
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: All network communication uses HTTPS
- **Certificate Validation**: Strict certificate validation for all requests
- **TLS Configuration**: Uses modern TLS versions with secure cipher suites

#### File System Security
- **Path Traversal Protection**: Prevents malicious archives from escaping extraction directories
- **Temporary File Security**: Secure temporary file creation and cleanup
- **Permission Management**: Proper file and directory permissions

#### Input Validation
- **Command Injection Prevention**: All user inputs are properly sanitized
- **Path Validation**: File paths are validated to prevent directory traversal
- **Configuration Validation**: Configuration files are validated before use

### Architecture Security

#### Dependency Management
- **Minimal Dependencies**: We minimize external dependencies to reduce attack surface
- **Dependency Auditing**: Regular security audits of all dependencies
- **Version Pinning**: Dependencies are pinned to specific versions

#### Code Security
- **Memory Safety**: Rust's memory safety prevents many common vulnerabilities
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling prevents information leakage
- **Secure Defaults**: All features use secure defaults

## 🔐 Security Best Practices for Users

### Installation Security
- **Download from Official Sources**: Only download from official repositories
- **Verify Signatures**: Always verify GPG signatures when available
- **Check Checksums**: Verify package checksums before installation

### Configuration Security
- **Secure Configuration**: Use secure configuration options
- **Access Control**: Properly configure file and directory permissions
- **Regular Updates**: Keep Packer updated to the latest version

### System Security
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Run Packer with minimal required permissions
- **Isolated Environment**: Consider using containers or virtual machines for testing
- **Backup System**: Maintain system backups before major operations

## 🚨 Security Advisories

### CVE-2025-0718 - TOCTOU Vulnerability in GPG Signature Verification (FIXED)

**Severity**: Critical  
**CVSS Score**: 9.1 (Critical)  
**Affected Versions**: 0.1.0 
**Fixed in Version**: 0.2.0
**Release Date**: 2025-07-18  

#### Description
A Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition vulnerability was discovered in the GPG signature verification process. The vulnerable code performed separate existence checks and file operations, creating a window where an attacker could swap signature files between the check and use operations.

#### Impact
- **Package Integrity**: Signature verification could be bypassed
- **Supply Chain Attack**: Malicious packages could be accepted as legitimate
- **Authentication Bypass**: GPG signature validation could be circumvented

#### Technical Details
The vulnerability existed in `src/gpg_manager.rs` where file existence checks and file operations were not atomic:

```rust
// VULNERABLE CODE (Fixed in 0.2.0)
if !sig_file.exists() {               
    sig_file = package_path.with_extension("asc");
}
if !sig_file.exists() {
    return Ok(SignatureVerificationResult { ... });
}
self.verify_detached_signature(package_path, &sig_file).await  // Use
```

#### Fix Implementation
- **Atomic File Operations**: Combined check and use operations
- **Signature Format Validation**: Validates PGP signature headers
- **Path Canonicalization**: Prevents directory traversal attacks
- **Empty File Detection**: Rejects empty signature files

#### Action Required
**Immediate upgrade to version 0.2.0 is required for all users.**

## 🚧 Known Security Considerations

### Current Limitations
- **AUR Package Security**: AUR packages are built from source and may contain untrusted code
- **Build Process Security**: Package build processes run with user privileges
- **Cache Security**: Package cache may contain sensitive information

### Mitigation Strategies
- **User Education**: Clear documentation about security risks
- **Sandboxing**: Future versions may include sandboxed build environments
- **Enhanced Verification**: Planned improvements to package verification
