# Contributing to Packer

Thanks for wanting to help make Packer better! This guide will show you how to get started.

## Quick Start

1. **Fork the project** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** to your computer
3. **Make your changes** 
4. **Test everything works**
5. **Submit a pull request**

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

### What You Need

- Rust (latest stable version)
- Git
- A text editor or IDE
- Basic knowledge of Rust programming

### Getting the Code

```bash
# Fork the repo on GitHub first, then:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/packer.git
cd packer

# Add the original repo as upstream
git remote add upstream https://github.com/d0mkaaa/packer.git
```

### Building and Testing

```bash
# Build the project
cargo build

# Run tests
cargo test

# Check for code style issues
cargo clippy

# Format your code
cargo fmt
```

## Making Changes

### Before You Start

- Check if someone else is already working on the same thing
- Open an issue to discuss big changes first
- Keep changes focused - one feature per pull request

### Writing Good Code

**Keep it simple**: Write code that's easy to read and understand.

**Add comments**: Explain why you did something, not just what you did.

**Test your changes**: Make sure everything still works after your changes.

**Follow the style**: Use `cargo fmt` to format your code properly.

### Commit Messages

Write clear commit messages that explain what you changed:

```
Good: "Fix broken pipe error in search command"
Bad: "fix bug"
```
